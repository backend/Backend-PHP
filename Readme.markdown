Backend-PHP
============

Backend-PHP is a basic code base that provides REST functionality using MVC architecture.

It also has the following advantages:

* Unit Testable and Tested using PHPUnit
* ZEND Coding Standards compliant
* Can be called using the command line or a web client (like a browser)

It serves as the ideal low level base for applications or frameworks that need to be
RESTful and done using MVC. The code base is divided in to Components, managed as git sub
modules.

Installation
----------

    git clone git@github.com:backend/Backend-PHP.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Usage
----

###Command Line

    cd public
    php index.php GET contacts #Will run contacts/read/0
    php index.php DELETE contacts/3 #Will run contacts/delete/3
    php index.php GET contacts/3 json #Will run contacts/delete/3 with the JsonView

###HTTP

    curl --data contacts --data _method=POST http://localhost/backend-core/public/index.php #Will run contacts/create
      #Will run contacts/update/3
    curl --data contacts/3 http://localhost/backend-core/public/index.php  #Will run contacts/read/3

Details
------

RESTfullnes is achieved in the Web environment by checking the following for the HTTP
verb to use:

* A `_method` POST variable
* A `X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE` header sent with the request
* The HTTP request's method

The MVC components are structured as follows:

* All Application Logic happens in the Controller
* All Business Logic happens in the Model
* All Output happens in the View

The Application class holds everything together.
